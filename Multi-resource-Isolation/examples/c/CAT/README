OVERVIEW
========

This is example code to demonstrate the use of PQoS/Intel(R) Resource Director
Technology (Intel(R) RDT) library APIs to manage Cache Allocation Technology
(CAT). Refer to https://github.com/01org/intel-cmt-cat/blob/master/README table
1 for a list of processors supporting CAT. CAT sample application build will
create three targets as follows:
1. allocation_app - Demonstrates usage of PQoS/Intel(R) RDT library APIs
related to set bit mask for class of service (CLOS) and displaying
class of service (CLOS) and associated bit mask.
2. association_app - Demonstrates usage of PQoS/Intel(R) RDT library APIs
related to association of class of service (CLOS) to cores and displaying
class of service (CLOS) and core association.
3. reset_app - Demonstrates usage of PQoS/Intel(R) RDT library APIs related to
resetting all classes of service to system default bit mask.
All apps operate in user space and use PQoS/Intel(R) RDT and C libraries only.


COMPILATION
===========

Note: The PQoS/Intel(R) RDT library should be installed before compilation.

Run "make all" or "make" to compile the programs. If compilation is successful
"allocation_app", "association_app" and "reset_app" binaries should be present
in the directory.

Run "make clean" to clean the build files.


USAGE
=====

To run:
$ sudo ./allocation_app
$ sudo ./association_app
$ sudo ./reset_app

For more usage options:
Run the app as stated up above with the "-h" option.
